# MealHelper
Meal Helper is a program written in MIPS assembly allowing the user to store data for a small selection of items in a pantry along with calculating calorie count for meals.

# Status
Project was submitted back in May. I would like to make changes eventually but it is not a top priority for me to do so. Documentation will at least be updated later.
